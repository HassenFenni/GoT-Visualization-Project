# GoT-Visualization-Project

In this project, we work on the Game Of Thrones dataset and exploit it for Data Visualization purposes using R to create a Shiny App using dplyr, ggplot, cartography and sf.
The final output is a Shiny App that launches to a Home Page and implements 4 interfaces that we can navigate through thanks to a navigation bar at the top of the application's interface.
In the report above, we talk in detail about the interfaces that compose our application and the different plots that it offers.
